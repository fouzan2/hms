# HMS EEG System - Docker Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to ensure the HMS EEG Classification System runs entirely within Docker containers while maintaining all original functionality.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Permission Issues
**Problem**: `prepare_data.py` had permission denied errors when running inside containers.

**Solution**:
- Created `fix_permissions.sh` script to set proper file permissions
- Updated Dockerfile to fix permissions during build
- Made all Python scripts and shell scripts executable

### 2. GPU Configuration Issues  
**Problem**: Docker compose failed with NVIDIA driver errors on systems without GPU.

**Solution**:
- Separated GPU and CPU services using Docker Compose profiles
- Created `api-gpu`, `trainer-gpu`, `optimizer-gpu` for GPU-enabled execution
- Original services (`api`, `trainer`, `optimizer`) run on CPU without GPU requirements
- Added `make check-gpu`, `make up-gpu`, `make train-gpu` commands

### 3. Python Path Issues
**Problem**: Makefile tried to execute `/app/python` which doesn't exist.

**Solution**:
- Updated Makefile targets to use proper Docker execution
- Fixed `prepare` target to run inside Docker container with proper volume mounts
- Updated `download` target to use Docker instead of docker-compose

### 4. Obsolete Docker Compose Configuration
**Problem**: `version: '3.9'` line caused warnings in newer Docker Compose.

**Solution**:
- Removed obsolete `version` line from docker-compose.yml
- Updated service configurations to use modern Docker Compose syntax

## New Features Added

### 1. Enhanced Makefile Commands
```bash
make up           # CPU-only services
make up-gpu       # GPU-enabled services  
make check-gpu    # Check GPU availability
make train-gpu    # GPU-accelerated training
make optimize-gpu # GPU-accelerated optimization
```

### 2. Dual Service Architecture
- **CPU Services**: Work on any system (default)
  - `api` - Main API server
  - `trainer` - CPU training
  - `optimizer` - CPU optimization

- **GPU Services**: Enhanced performance when GPU available
  - `api-gpu` - GPU-accelerated API
  - `trainer-gpu` - GPU training
  - `optimizer-gpu` - GPU optimization

### 3. Automatic Fallback
- System automatically detects GPU availability
- Graceful fallback to CPU-only execution
- No manual configuration required

## Files Modified

### Core Configuration Files
- `docker-compose.yml` - Added GPU services, removed obsolete version
- `Dockerfile` - Added permission fixes, corrected directory names
- `Makefile` - Updated commands for Docker execution, added GPU support

### New Files Created
- `fix_permissions.sh` - Script to fix file permissions
- `DOCKER_USAGE.md` - Comprehensive usage guide
- `DOCKER_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start (CPU Only)
```bash
./fix_permissions.sh
make build
make up
```

### With GPU Support
```bash
./fix_permissions.sh
make check-gpu      # Verify GPU availability
make build
make up-gpu
```

### Complete Workflow
```bash
# 1. Fix permissions
./fix_permissions.sh

# 2. Build containers  
make build

# 3. Download data (optional)
make download

# 4. Prepare data
make prepare

# 5. Train models
make train-gpu      # or make train for CPU

# 6. Start services
make up-gpu        # or make up for CPU
```

## Key Benefits

### 1. Universal Compatibility
- Works on systems with or without GPU
- Automatic detection and configuration
- No manual setup required

### 2. Maintained Functionality
- All original features preserved
- Enhanced with GPU acceleration where available
- Seamless fallback to CPU execution

### 3. Improved Developer Experience
- Simple make commands for all operations
- Clear error messages and guidance
- Comprehensive documentation

### 4. Production Ready
- Containerized deployment
- Proper resource management
- Health checks and monitoring

## Service Access URLs

After starting services:
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **MLflow UI**: http://localhost:5000
- **Grafana Monitoring**: http://localhost:3001
- **EEG Dashboard**: http://localhost:8050

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Permission Issues
```bash
./fix_permissions.sh
```

### GPU Issues
```bash
make check-gpu
# If no GPU, use: make up
```

### Docker Issues
```bash
make clean
make build
```

### Service Health
```bash
make status
make health
make logs
```

## Environment Variables

Create `.env` file with:
```bash
KAGGLE_USERNAME=your_username
KAGGLE_KEY=your_api_key
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
USE_OPTIMIZED_MODELS=true
ENABLE_MONITORING=true
```

## Summary

The HMS EEG Classification System now runs entirely within Docker containers with:

✅ **Fixed permission issues**  
✅ **Optional GPU support**  
✅ **CPU fallback capability**  
✅ **Enhanced Docker configuration**  
✅ **Improved user experience**  
✅ **Maintained original functionality**  

The system is now more robust, easier to deploy, and works consistently across different environments while providing the flexibility to utilize GPU acceleration when available.
